## What I'm Doing Now

1. **Downloading NHANES** (public, no account) - environmental biomarkers
2. **Downloading PhysioNet public datasets** - HRV/ECG data
3. **Creating guided workflows** for you to sign up for NSRR and PhysioNet
4. **Documenting data use agreements** so you can complete them quickly

## What You Should Do

### Priority 1 (Do Today - 30 minutes total):
1. **Sign up for NSRR** (5 min): https://sleepdata.org/join
   - Use email: [your email]
   - Institution: "Independent Researcher"
   - Accept data use agreement

2. **Create PhysioNet account** (5 min): https://physionet.org/register/
   - Don't do training yet, just create account

3. **Register for All of Us** (10 min): https://www.researchallofus.org/register/
   - Start the registration process
   - You can complete training modules later

### Priority 2 (This Week - 2-3 hours):
1. **Complete PhysioNet CITI training** (2 hours)
   - This unlocks 50+ databases with autonomic/physiological data
   - Course: https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/

2. **Complete All of Us ethics training** (2-3 hours)
   - Required for workbench access

### Priority 3 (Later):
- **ABCD/NDA access**: Decide if worth pursuing institutional affiliation
- **UK Biobank**: Use published GWAS results instead of raw data

## Automated Scripts Ready

I've created scripts that will automatically:
- Download all NHANES environmental data ‚úì
- Download PhysioNet public databases ‚úì
- Parse NSRR data once you provide credentials
- Query All of Us workbench once you have access
