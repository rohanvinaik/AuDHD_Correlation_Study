## Analysis Strategy: Three Approaches

### Approach A: GWAS-Focused (STRONGEST)

**What:** Deep dive into genetic architecture

**Analysis Steps:**
1. **Genetic correlation** (LDSC)
   - Quantify shared genetics between ADHD and autism
   - Compare with other psychiatric disorders
   
2. **Locus-level analysis**
   - Identify shared risk loci
   - Find disorder-specific variants
   
3. **Gene-set enrichment**
   - Neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, GABA)
   - Immune pathways
   - Metabolic pathways
   - Synaptic function
   
4. **Functional annotation**
   - Map SNPs to genes
   - Tissue-specific expression (GTEx)
   - Druggable targets

5. **Polygenic architecture**
   - Compare effect size distributions
   - Test for polygenicity vs. few large effects

**Publishability:** HIGH
- Novel integration of latest GWAS
- Identifies biological subtypes from genetics
- Predicts drug targets

**Example Title:** "Genomic Dissection of ADHD and Autism Reveals Distinct Neurotransmitter-Specific Subtypes"

### Approach B: Multi-Omics Meta-Analysis (MODERATE)

**What:** Integrate multiple public datasets despite small sizes

**Analysis Steps:**
1. **Download all relevant public data:**
   - MetaboLights metabolomics studies (n~500 total)
   - SRA microbiome datasets (n~1,500 total)
   - GEO expression studies (n~2,000 total)
   - GWAS summary stats (already have)

2. **Harmonization:**
   - Standardize metabolite names
   - Normalize microbiome abundances
   - Batch correction across studies

3. **Meta-analysis:**
   - Meta-analyze effect sizes across studies
   - Identify consistent signals

4. **Integration:**
   - Multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA)
   - Network analysis linking layers
   
5. **Validation:**
   - Cross-study validation
   - Bootstrap stability

**Publishability:** MODERATE
- Small sample sizes per study
- Heterogeneity across studies
- But: Novel integration approach

**Example Title:** "Integrated Multi-Omics Meta-Analysis Identifies Gut-Brain-Immune Subtypes in Neurodevelopmental Disorders"

### Approach C: Pipeline + Simulation (METHODS PAPER)

**What:** Build complete pipeline, demonstrate with simulation

**Analysis Steps:**
1. **Pipeline development:**
   - Complete data integration code
   - Clustering algorithms
   - Validation framework
   - Visualization dashboard

2. **Simulation study:**
   - Generate realistic multi-omics data
   - Add known subtypes
   - Test pipeline recovery

3. **Public data demonstration:**
   - Apply to available GWAS/omics data
   - Show pipeline works on real data

4. **Make fully reproducible:**
   - Docker container
   - Complete documentation
   - Zenodo archive

**Publishability:** MODERATE-HIGH
- Methods papers valuable
- Reproducibility highly valued
- Easier to get collaborators after

**Example Title:** "A Reproducible Multi-Omics Pipeline for Biological Subtype Discovery in Heterogeneous Disorders"

## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid

**Phase 1 (Week 1): GWAS Analysis** - Start immediately
- Strongest data we have
- Can generate real results
- Foundation for other analyses

**Phase 2 (Week 2): Download Public Multi-Omics**
- While GWAS runs, download everything available
- Even if small, shows integration works
- May find unexpected patterns

**Phase 3 (Week 3): Integration + Methods Paper**
- Combine GWAS + public multi-omics
- Document complete pipeline
- Generate comprehensive report

**Deliverable:** 
- Working analysis with real results
- Complete reproducible pipeline  
- Potential for 1-2 publications
- Portfolio piece for future collaborations

## Publication Opportunities

### Realistic Targets (Public Data)

**Tier 1 - High Probability:**
- *PLOS ONE* - Broad scope, accepts replication studies
- *Scientific Reports* - Nature family, open access
- *Frontiers in Psychiatry* - Open access, rapid review
- *BMC Bioinformatics* - For methods/pipeline papers

**Tier 2 - Possible with Strong Results:**
- *Translational Psychiatry* - Nature family
- *Molecular Psychiatry* - If findings very novel
- *Biological Psychiatry: CNNI* - Computational focus

**Tier 3 - Long Shot (Would need controlled data):**
- *Nature Genetics* - Top tier, unlikely with public data only
- *Nature Neuroscience* - Same

### What Reviewers Will Say

**Expected criticisms:**
- "Sample sizes are small" (true for metabolomics/microbiome)
- "No validation cohort" (we can do cross-validation)
- "Needs replication" (that's what meta-analysis does)

**Our strengths:**
- "Novel integration approach" 
- "Fully reproducible"
- "Hypothesis-generating"
- "Large genetics sample"

**Strategy:** Frame as "discovery" not "validation" study

## Collaboration Opportunities After

Once you have working pipeline + preliminary results:

**Approach researchers with data:**
- "I've built this pipeline and shown it works"
- "I have preliminary results from public data"
- "Would you be interested in applying to your cohort?"

**This is much easier than:**
- "I have an idea, can I get your data?"

**Many collaborations start this way:**
1. Individual builds interesting method
2. Shows it works on public data
3. Groups with private data get interested
4. Collaboration forms

## Time Investment

**Your time:** 5-10 hours total
- Review progress (30 min/day)
- Interpret results (2-3 hours)
- Decide on next steps (1 hour)
- Write manuscript (later, optional)

**My time (automated):**
- Data download: 4-6 hours
- Processing: 2-4 hours  
- Analysis: 4-8 hours
- Report generation: 1-2 hours

**Total timeline:** 2-3 weeks for complete analysis

## What Happens Next

I will:
1. Download all available public data
2. Process and harmonize datasets
3. Run genetic correlation analysis
4. Attempt multi-omics integration
5. Generate clustering results
6. Create comprehensive report
7. Assess publication potential

You:
- Check in periodically
- Review results when ready
- Decide whether to pursue publication

**No applications needed. No waiting. Let's just do science.**

## The Bottom Line

**Can you do the original study plan?** No - requires institutional access.

**Can you do impressive, publishable research anyway?** Yes - with public data.

**Is it worth doing?** Absolutely:
- Learn the methods
- Generate real results
- Build portfolio
- Potential publication(s)
- Foundation for future collaboration

**Let's stop talking about access and start analyzing data.**
