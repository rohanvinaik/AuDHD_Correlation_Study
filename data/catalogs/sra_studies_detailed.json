    "abstract":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition which is defined by decreased social communication and the presence of repetitive or stereotypic behaviors. Recent evidence has suggested that the gut-brain axis may be important in neurodevelopment in general and may play a role in ASD in particular. Here, we present a study of the gut microbiome in 96 individuals diagnosed with ASD in Israel, compared to 42 neurotypical individuals. We determined differences in alpha and beta diversity in the microbiome of individuals with ASD and demonstrated that the phylum Bacteroidetes and genus Bacteroides were the most significantly over-represented in individuals with ASD. To understand the possible functional significance of these changes, we treated newborn mice with Bacteroides fragilis at birth. B. fragilis-treated male mice displayed social behavior dysfunction, increased repetitive behaviors and gene expression dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex, while female mice did not display behavioral deficits. These findings suggest that overabundance of Bacteroides, particularly in early life, may have functional consequences for individuals with ASD. Overall design: in order to determine the difference in alpha and beta diversity in the microbiome, 96 individuals diagnosed with ASD in Israel, caompared to 42 neurotypical individualsa. In order to understand the possible functional significance of these changes,  newborn Wild-type mice (C57BL\/6J) treated with Bacteroides fragilis at birth.",

    "abstract":"Intestinal microorganisms impact on health maintaining gut homeostasis and shaping the host immunity, while gut dysbiosis associates with many conditions including autism, a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with multifactorial aetiology. In autism, gut dysbiosis correlates with symptom severity and is characterized by a reduced bacterial variability and a diminished beneficial commensal relationship. Microbiota can influence the expression of host microRNAs that, in turn, regulate the growth of intestinal bacteria by means of bidirectional host-gut micro-biota cross-talk. We investigated possible interactions among intestinal microbes and between them and host transcriptional modulators in autism.

    "abstract":"This data has been publicly released and includes a set of de-identified gut microbiome samples from 61 undergraduate students. Each student was assessed using the ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), which has two subscales (inattention and hyperactivity). Those who scored 17 or above on either or both subscales were considered likely to have ADHD (Rosler et al, 2010). Sample names include group (Control or ADHD), gender, ASRS score (format: inattention\/hyperactivity) and overall diagnosis (Control, or ADHD inattentive\/hyperactive\/both). Participants in this study were given an Omnigene-Gut OMR-200 stool sample collection kit for sample collection, which they returned on average within three days (SD=2.48). DNA sequencing was then performed at Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ) where DNA was extracted from a 200-microliter vortexed fecal sample solution from the Omnigene Gut Collection Tube using the Zymo BIOMICS DNA Mini-Kit. Sequencing Details (copied directly from the Zymo Research Metagenomic Services Report): For each sample, 200 microliters were used for DNA extraction, which was performed with in-house format (low bioburden) of ZR Fecal DNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, CA, US). The DNA extraction was performed in a clean room to minimize contamination by following the manufacturer's protocol. Two process controls (negative controls) were run simultaneously by replacing 200 microliters of customer samples with 200 microliters of pure water to assess the bioburden in the DNA extraction process. These two controls were profiled together with the customers' samples in the subsequent process. Bacterial 16S ribosmal RNA gene targeting sequencing was performed. The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014). The two paired-end reads in each pair were assembled to construct a complete amplicon sequence with SeqPrep (https:\/\/github.com\/jstjohn\/SeqPrep). Chimeric amplicon sequences were identified and removed with Usearch (v. 6.1) (Edgar et al, 2011) in de novo mode. Amplicon sequences smaller than 302 bp were removed. Post-processing using differential analysis (Jackson et al, 1991) revealed three samples as outliers, fairly consistent with the \"three-sigma rule\" (Ruan, 2005) in the normal distribution; we recommend not including these in any analyses.",

    "abstract":"This data has been publicly released and includes a set of de-identified gut microbiome samples from 61 undergraduate students. Each student was assessed using the ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), which has two subscales (inattention and hyperactivity). Those who scored 17 or above on either or both subscales were considered likely to have ADHD (Rosler et al, 2010). Sample names include group (Control or ADHD), gender, ASRS score (format: inattention\/hyperactivity) and overall diagnosis (Control, or ADHD inattentive\/hyperactive\/both). Participants in this study were given an Omnigene-Gut OMR-200 stool sample collection kit for sample collection, which they returned on average within three days (SD=2.48). DNA sequencing was then performed at Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ) where DNA was extracted from a 200-microliter vortexed fecal sample solution from the Omnigene Gut Collection Tube using the Zymo BIOMICS DNA Mini-Kit. Sequencing Details (copied directly from the Zymo Research Metagenomic Services Report): For each sample, 200 microliters were used for DNA extraction, which was performed with in-house format (low bioburden) of ZR Fecal DNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, CA, US). The DNA extraction was performed in a clean room to minimize contamination by following the manufacturer's protocol. Two process controls (negative controls) were run simultaneously by replacing 200 microliters of customer samples with 200 microliters of pure water to assess the bioburden in the DNA extraction process. These two controls were profiled together with the customers' samples in the subsequent process. Bacterial 16S ribosmal RNA gene targeting sequencing was performed. The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014).

The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014). The two paired-end reads in each pair were assembled to construct a complete amplicon sequence with SeqPrep (https:\/\/github.com\/jstjohn\/SeqPrep). Chimeric amplicon sequences were identified and removed with Usearch (v. 6.1) (Edgar et al, 2011) in de novo mode. Amplicon sequences smaller than 302 bp were removed. Post-processing using differential analysis (Jackson et al, 1991) revealed three samples as outliers, fairly consistent with the \"three-sigma rule\" (Ruan, 2005) in the normal distribution; we recommend not including these in any analyses.",

Participants in this study were given an Omnigene-Gut OMR-200 stool sample collection kit for sample collection, which they returned on average within three days (SD=2.48). DNA sequencing was then performed at Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ) where DNA was extracted from a 200-microliter vortexed fecal sample solution from the Omnigene Gut Collection Tube using the Zymo BIOMICS DNA Mini-Kit. Sequencing Details (copied directly from the Zymo Research Metagenomic Services Report): For each sample, 200 microliters were used for DNA extraction, which was performed with in-house format (low bioburden) of ZR Fecal DNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, CA, US). The DNA extraction was performed in a clean room to minimize contamination by following the manufacturer's protocol. Two process controls (negative controls) were run simultaneously by replacing 200 microliters of customer samples with 200 microliters of pure water to assess the bioburden in the DNA extraction process. These two controls were profiled together with the customers' samples in the subsequent process. Bacterial 16S ribosmal RNA gene targeting sequencing was performed. The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014). The two paired-end reads in each pair were assembled to construct a complete amplicon sequence with SeqPrep (https:\/\/github.com\/jstjohn\/SeqPrep). Chimeric amplicon sequences were identified and removed with Usearch (v. 6.1) (Edgar et al, 2011) in de novo mode. Amplicon sequences smaller than 302 bp were removed. Post-processing using differential analysis (Jackson et al, 1991) revealed three samples as outliers, fairly consistent with the \"three-sigma rule\" (Ruan, 2005) in the normal distribution; we recommend not including these in any analyses.",

    "abstract":"This data has been publicly released and includes a set of de-identified gut microbiome samples from 61 undergraduate students. Each student was assessed using the ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), which has two subscales (inattention and hyperactivity). Those who scored 17 or above on either or both subscales were considered likely to have ADHD (Rosler et al, 2010). Sample names include group (Control or ADHD), gender, ASRS score (format: inattention\/hyperactivity) and overall diagnosis (Control, or ADHD inattentive\/hyperactive\/both). Participants in this study were given an Omnigene-Gut OMR-200 stool sample collection kit for sample collection, which they returned on average within three days (SD=2.48). DNA sequencing was then performed at Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ) where DNA was extracted from a 200-microliter vortexed fecal sample solution from the Omnigene Gut Collection Tube using the Zymo BIOMICS DNA Mini-Kit. Sequencing Details (copied directly from the Zymo Research Metagenomic Services Report): For each sample, 200 microliters were used for DNA extraction, which was performed with in-house format (low bioburden) of ZR Fecal DNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, CA, US). The DNA extraction was performed in a clean room to minimize contamination by following the manufacturer's protocol. Two process controls (negative controls) were run simultaneously by replacing 200 microliters of customer samples with 200 microliters of pure water to assess the bioburden in the DNA extraction process. These two controls were profiled together with the customers' samples in the subsequent process. Bacterial 16S ribosmal RNA gene targeting sequencing was performed. The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014). The two paired-end reads in each pair were assembled to construct a complete amplicon sequence with SeqPrep (https:\/\/github.com\/jstjohn\/SeqPrep). Chimeric amplicon sequences were identified and removed with Usearch (v. 6.1) (Edgar et al, 2011) in de novo mode. Amplicon sequences smaller than 302 bp were removed. Post-processing using differential analysis (Jackson et al, 1991) revealed three samples as outliers, fairly consistent with the \"three-sigma rule\" (Ruan, 2005) in the normal distribution; we recommend not including these in any analyses.",

    "abstract":"This data has been publicly released and includes a set of de-identified gut microbiome samples from 61 undergraduate students. Each student was assessed using the ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), which has two subscales (inattention and hyperactivity). Those who scored 17 or above on either or both subscales were considered likely to have ADHD (Rosler et al, 2010). Sample names include group (Control or ADHD), gender, ASRS score (format: inattention\/hyperactivity) and overall diagnosis (Control, or ADHD inattentive\/hyperactive\/both). Participants in this study were given an Omnigene-Gut OMR-200 stool sample collection kit for sample collection, which they returned on average within three days (SD=2.48). DNA sequencing was then performed at Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ) where DNA was extracted from a 200-microliter vortexed fecal sample solution from the Omnigene Gut Collection Tube using the Zymo BIOMICS DNA Mini-Kit. Sequencing Details (copied directly from the Zymo Research Metagenomic Services Report): For each sample, 200 microliters were used for DNA extraction, which was performed with in-house format (low bioburden) of ZR Fecal DNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, CA, US). The DNA extraction was performed in a clean room to minimize contamination by following the manufacturer's protocol. Two process controls (negative controls) were run simultaneously by replacing 200 microliters of customer samples with 200 microliters of pure water to assess the bioburden in the DNA extraction process. These two controls were profiled together with the customers' samples in the subsequent process. Bacterial 16S ribosmal RNA gene targeting sequencing was performed. The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014).

The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014). The two paired-end reads in each pair were assembled to construct a complete amplicon sequence with SeqPrep (https:\/\/github.com\/jstjohn\/SeqPrep). Chimeric amplicon sequences were identified and removed with Usearch (v. 6.1) (Edgar et al, 2011) in de novo mode. Amplicon sequences smaller than 302 bp were removed. Post-processing using differential analysis (Jackson et al, 1991) revealed three samples as outliers, fairly consistent with the \"three-sigma rule\" (Ruan, 2005) in the normal distribution; we recommend not including these in any analyses.",

Participants in this study were given an Omnigene-Gut OMR-200 stool sample collection kit for sample collection, which they returned on average within three days (SD=2.48). DNA sequencing was then performed at Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ) where DNA was extracted from a 200-microliter vortexed fecal sample solution from the Omnigene Gut Collection Tube using the Zymo BIOMICS DNA Mini-Kit. Sequencing Details (copied directly from the Zymo Research Metagenomic Services Report): For each sample, 200 microliters were used for DNA extraction, which was performed with in-house format (low bioburden) of ZR Fecal DNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, CA, US). The DNA extraction was performed in a clean room to minimize contamination by following the manufacturer's protocol. Two process controls (negative controls) were run simultaneously by replacing 200 microliters of customer samples with 200 microliters of pure water to assess the bioburden in the DNA extraction process. These two controls were profiled together with the customers' samples in the subsequent process. Bacterial 16S ribosmal RNA gene targeting sequencing was performed. The general bacterial 16S primers used were 313f (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806r (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), which amplified the v3-4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared by following a published protocol (Kozich et al, 2013) with some modifications to prevent PCR chimera formation: the number of PCR cycles is carefully controlled for each sample, so that the reaction can generate enough product and does not overrun. The amplicon libraries were cleaned up with Zymo's Select-a-Size DNA Clean and Concentrator (>200 fragments were kept), quantified with TapeStation, normalized and pooled together. The final library was quantified with qPCR and sequenced Illumina MiSeq with v2 reagent kit (500 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX mix and in paired-end mode. Raw sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-0.33 (Bolger et al, 2014). The two paired-end reads in each pair were assembled to construct a complete amplicon sequence with SeqPrep (https:\/\/github.com\/jstjohn\/SeqPrep). Chimeric amplicon sequences were identified and removed with Usearch (v. 6.1) (Edgar et al, 2011) in de novo mode. Amplicon sequences smaller than 302 bp were removed. Post-processing using differential analysis (Jackson et al, 1991) revealed three samples as outliers, fairly consistent with the \"three-sigma rule\" (Ruan, 2005) in the normal distribution; we recommend not including these in any analyses.",

High levels of F. prausnitzii were associated to increase of fecal butyrate levels within normal range, and over representation of KEGG functions related to butyrate production in ASD patients.

Consistently, qualitative and quantitative alteration of bacterial metabolites may functionally affect autism pathophysiology. Up to date, assigning a specific microbial signature to ASD is quite difficult also because of the lack of age-restricted cohort studies. We investigated the gut microbiota (GM) composition and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels in a cohort of young children (2-4 years of age) with ASD, with respect to age-matched neurotypical healthy controls. Strong increase of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and decrease of Actinobacteria was observed in these patients. Among the 91 OTUs whose relative abundance was altered in ASD patients, we observed a striking depletion of Bifidobacterium longum, one of the dominant bacteria in infant GM and, conversely, an increase of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a late colonizer of healthy human gut and a major butyrate producer. High levels of F. prausnitzii were associated to increase of fecal butyrate levels within normal range, and over representation of KEGG functions related to butyrate production in ASD patients.

    "abstract":"Proliferation and\/or depletion of clusters of specific bacteria regulate intestinal functions and may interfere with neuro-immune communication and behavior in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Consistently, qualitative and quantitative alteration of bacterial metabolites may functionally affect autism pathophysiology. Up to date, assigning a specific microbial signature to ASD is quite difficult also because of the lack of age-restricted cohort studies. We investigated the gut microbiota (GM) composition and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels in a cohort of young children (2-4 years of age) with ASD, with respect to age-matched neurotypical healthy controls. Strong increase of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and decrease of Actinobacteria was observed in these patients. Among the 91 OTUs whose relative abundance was altered in ASD patients, we observed a striking depletion of Bifidobacterium longum, one of the dominant bacteria in infant GM and, conversely, an increase of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a late colonizer of healthy human gut and a major butyrate producer. High levels of F. prausnitzii were associated to increase of fecal butyrate levels within normal range, and over representation of KEGG functions related to butyrate production in ASD patients. Here we report unbalance of GM composition and shift in colonization of gut beneficial bacterial species in ASD patients as off early childhood.",
