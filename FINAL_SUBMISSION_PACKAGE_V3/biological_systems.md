## B.2 Pathway-Level Biology

### B.2.1 Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance

**E/I Ratio Hypothesis** (Rubenstein & Merzenich 2003):
$$\text{E/I ratio} = \frac{\text{Glutamatergic excitation}}{\text{GABAergic inhibition}}$$

**Predictions**:
- Increased E/I → hyperexcitability, seizures, sensory hypersensitivity
- Decreased E/I → reduced plasticity, cognitive impairment

**Our findings support**:
- Glutamatergic pattern (highest enrichment) → excessive excitation
- GABAergic pattern (high enrichment) → reduced inhibition
- Combined effect: Elevated E/I ratio in AuDHD

**Evidence from our data**:
- Glutamatergic mean enrichment (1006) > GABAergic (633) in absolute terms
- Both patterns show >97% cross-disorder replication
- Suggests E/I imbalance is core shared feature

### B.2.2 Monoamine Modulation

**Dopamine**: Attention, motivation, reward processing
- Primary ADHD neurotransmitter
- Dopaminergic pattern shows only 59% replication → ADHD-specific
- Lower shared enrichment (197) than glutamate/GABA patterns

**Serotonin**: Mood, aggression, social behavior
- TPH2 pattern shows 100% replication across disorders
- Moderate enrichment (215)
- Trans-diagnostic role (aggression, mood dysregulation)

**Hypothesis**: Monoamines modulate core E/I circuits rather than being primary drivers of shared genetics.

### B.2.3 Network Interactions

**Glutamate-GABA coupling**:
- GABAergic interneurons excited by glutamatergic inputs
- Disruption propagates: Glu ↑ → insufficient GABA compensation → runaway excitation

**Dopamine-Glutamate interactions**:
- Dopamine modulates glutamate release in striatum and prefrontal cortex
- D1 receptors → enhance glutamate transmission
- D2 receptors → suppress glutamate release

**Serotonin-GABA interactions**:
- 5-HT3 receptors on GABAergic interneurons
- Serotonin modulates inhibitory tone

---

## B.3 Developmental Trajectories

### B.3.1 Critical Period Hypothesis

**GRIN2B dominance in development**:
- NR2B (GRIN2B) subunits predominate in immature synapses
- Developmental switch to NR2A (GRIN2A) in mature synapses
- Disruption during critical periods → persistent circuit abnormalities

**GABRB2/3 developmental expression**:
- GABRB3 on maternal chromosome 15 subject to imprinting
- Abnormal dosage during development → altered inhibition

### B.3.2 Temporal Enrichment Patterns

Our analysis is cross-sectional (adult genetics), but enrichment may reflect:
- **Early hits**: Genes critical in early development (GRIN2B, GABRB3)
- **Late compensation**: Genes involved in homeostatic compensation (GRM5)
- **Persistent effects**: Genes affecting lifelong function (GRIN2A, GABRB2)

---

## B.4 Clinical Translation Framework (Hypothetical)

### B.4.1 Pattern-Based Treatment Hypotheses

**Glutamatergic-Extreme Pattern** (GRIN2A, GRM5, GRIA1, GRIN2B):
- **Hypothesis**: Excessive glutamate signaling
- **Potential interventions** (require validation):
  - mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (e.g., basimglurant)
  - NMDA receptor modulators (e.g., memantine - use caution)
  - AMPA receptor modulation
- **Evidence**: Mavoglurant (mGluR5 antagonist) FAILED in fragile X trials
- **Caution**: Strong genetic signal ≠ therapeutic efficacy

**GABAergic Pattern** (GABRB1, GABRB2, GABRB3):
- **Hypothesis**: Reduced GABAergic inhibition
- **Potential interventions** (require validation):
  - GABAergic positive modulators
  - Avoid GABAA antagonists (would worsen)
- **Caution**: Benzodiazepines carry addiction risk; use requires careful evaluation

**Serotonergic Pattern** (TPH2):
- **Hypothesis**: Reduced serotonin synthesis
- **Potential interventions** (require validation):
  - SSRIs (if comorbid anxiety/aggression)
  - 5-HTP supplementation (controversial)
- **Evidence**: SSRIs show mixed efficacy in autism

**Dopaminergic Pattern** (COMT, DDC, DRD2, DRD5):
- **Hypothesis**: Reduced dopamine signaling (ADHD-dominant)
- **Potential interventions** (established for ADHD):
  - Stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamine)
  - Dopamine reuptake inhibitors
- **Evidence**: Strong for ADHD; limited for autism

### B.4.2 Why These Are NOT Ready for Clinical Use

**Critical gaps**:
1. **Gene enrichment ≠ treatment target**: Genetic association doesn't prove causal mechanism
2. **No patient stratification**: Gene patterns don't identify which patients have which biology
3. **Direction of effect unknown**: Enrichment could reflect loss- or gain-of-function
4. **No clinical trial data**: Treatment hypotheses untested in genotype-stratified trials
5. **Pleiotropy**: Genes have multiple functions; targeting may have unintended effects
6. **mGluR5 paradox**: Strong genetic signal (GRM5 enrichment=1144) but mavoglurant trial failed

**Required next steps**:
1. Functional validation (cell culture, animal models)
2. Patient genotyping with phenotype correlation
3. Biomarker development (e.g., EEG measures of E/I balance)
4. Genotype-stratified clinical trials
5. Health economics analysis

## B.5 Evolutionary Perspective

### B.5.1 Balancing Selection

**Hypothesis**: Neurodevelopmental genetic variants maintained by balancing selection

**Evidence**:
- Minor allele frequencies often >5% (not rare)
- Polygenic architecture (many small effects)
- Persist despite negative selection on extreme phenotypes

**Possible mechanisms**:
- **Heterozygote advantage**: Mild variants confer cognitive benefits
- **Frequency-dependent selection**: Optimal population mix of cognitive styles
- **Trade-offs**: Attention vs. focus, social vs. analytical cognition

### B.5.2 Gene-Environment Interactions

Modern environment mismatches with evolved neurobiology:
- **ADHD**: "Hunter vs. farmer" hypothesis (Eisenberg et al. 2008)
- **Autism**: Enhanced focus beneficial in specialized roles
- **AuDHD**: Combination may be maladaptive in modern school/work settings

---

## B.6 Genetic Architecture

### B.6.1 Common vs. Rare Variant Contributions

**Our analysis**: Common variants (MAF >1%) captured by GWAS

**Missing**:
- **Rare variants** (MAF <1%): Larger effect sizes, may define subtypes
- **De novo mutations**: Important in simplex autism
- **Copy number variants**: 15q11-q13 duplications (GABRB3)
- **Structural variants**: Inversions, translocations

**Implication**: Enrichment patterns reflect common variant architecture; rare variants may show different patterns.

### B.6.2 Epistasis and Gene-Gene Interactions

Our analysis treats genes independently. Reality:
- **Epistasis**: Gene effects depend on genetic background
- **Pathway buffering**: Redundancy within pathways
- **Compensatory mutations**: One gene compensates for another

**Example**:
- GRIN2A and GRIN2B both encode NMDA receptor subunits
- Effects may be non-additive (epistatic)
- Clustering may reflect functional redundancy

### B.6.3 Polygenic Risk Scores

**Polygenic risk score** (PRS) aggregates genome-wide effects:
$$\text{PRS} = \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_i \cdot \text{genotype}_i$$

where $\beta_i$ are GWAS effect sizes.

**Our patterns** could inform weighted PRS:
- Upweight glutamatergic/GABAergic variants
- Downweight polygenetic pattern variants
- Test if pattern-informed PRS improves prediction

## B.7 Multi-Omic Integration

### B.7.1 Transcriptomics

**Question**: Do enrichment patterns correlate with brain gene expression?

**Data sources**:
- GTEx: Gene expression across brain regions
- BrainSpan: Developmental transcriptomics
- Single-cell RNA-seq: Cell-type-specific expression

**Hypotheses**:
- Glutamatergic genes → expressed in excitatory neurons (cortical layers 2/3, 5)
- GABAergic genes → expressed in interneurons (parvalbumin+, somatostatin+)
- Pattern coherence may reflect co-expression modules

### B.7.2 Proteomics

**Post-translational regulation**:
- GRM5: Regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination
- GABAA receptors: Trafficking dependent on phosphorylation state

**Protein-protein interactions**:
- NMDA receptors form macromolecular complexes
- Disruption of scaffolding (PSD-95) affects glutamate signaling

### B.7.3 Metabolomics

**Neurotransmitter levels**:
- Glutamate, GABA in CSF or MRS
- Serotonin metabolites (5-HIAA)
- Dopamine metabolites (HVA)

**Correlation hypothesis**: Genetic patterns → altered metabolite profiles

### B.7.4 Neuroimaging

**Structural MRI**:
- Cortical thickness, surface area
- Subcortical volumes (basal ganglia, amygdala)

**Functional MRI**:
- Resting-state networks (default mode, salience)
- Task-based activation (attention, social cognition)

**MR Spectroscopy**:
- Direct measurement of glutamate, GABA, glutamine
- Test E/I balance hypothesis in vivo

**Hypothesis**: Enrichment patterns → neuroimaging endophenotypes

## B.8 Limitations of Biological Interpretation

### B.8.1 Genetic Association ≠ Causation

**GWAS identifies association, not mechanism**:
- Linkage disequilibrium: Tagged SNPs may not be causal
- Regulatory variants: May affect distant genes
- Pleiotropy: Genes affect multiple phenotypes

**Example**: GABRB3 15q11-q13 region
- Multiple genes in LD
- Imprinting complicates interpretation
- Association may reflect other genes in region

### B.8.2 Direction of Effect Unknown

Enrichment indicates association, but:
- **Loss-of-function** vs. **gain-of-function** unknown from GWAS
- Different alleles may have opposite effects
- Context-dependent (developmental stage, cell type)

**Example**: GRM5
- Both hyper- and hypo-function implicated in autism
- mGluR5 antagonists failed in trials (suggest gain-of-function)
- But genetics don't specify direction

### B.8.3 Gene Function Complexity

Genes have multiple functions:
- **COMT**: Degrades dopamine AND norepinephrine
- **GRIN2A**: Synaptic AND extrasynaptic NMDA receptors
- **TPH2**: Affects all serotonin-dependent processes

**Implication**: Targeting gene may have widespread effects beyond intended pathway.

### B.8.4 Missing Biological Context

**Cell-type specificity**:
- GRIN2A in excitatory neurons vs. interneurons
- Effects may be cell-type-specific

**Brain region specificity**:
- Prefrontal cortex vs. striatum vs. hippocampus
- Regional heterogeneity not captured by bulk GWAS

**Developmental timing**:
- Effects during critical periods vs. adult brain
- Our analysis is cross-sectional

## B.9 Comparative Biology

### B.9.1 Evolutionary Conservation

**Sequence conservation** (PhyloP scores):
- GRIN2A: Highly conserved across mammals
- GRM5: Conserved receptor core, variable termini
- GABRB3: Moderate conservation

**Implication**: Core functions conserved; variants likely affect regulation or fine-tuning.

### B.9.2 Animal Models

**Mouse models**:
- Grin2a knockout: Impaired learning, seizures
- Grm5 knockout: Reduced anxiety, altered social behavior
- Gabrb3 knockout: Neonatal lethal (homozygous)

**Limitations**:
- Mouse behavior ≠ human autism/ADHD
- Knockout ≠ polygenic risk
- Need conditional, region-specific models

### B.9.3 Non-Human Primates

**Advantages**:
- More complex social behavior
- Closer brain structure to humans

**Challenges**:
- Ethical constraints
- Limited sample sizes for genetics
- Transgenic technology less developed

**Goal**: Integrate multi-scale data (genes → proteins → circuits → behavior)

---

## B.11 Clinical Heterogeneity

### B.11.1 Why Gene Patterns ≠ Patient Subtypes

**Gene enrichment patterns**: How genes group based on genetic associations

**Patient heterogeneity**: How individuals differ in symptoms, etiology, treatment response

**Gap**:
- Multiple genetic paths to same phenotype (genetic heterogeneity)
- Same genetic variant → different phenotypes (variable expressivity)
- Gene-environment interactions modify effects

**Implication**: Cannot use these patterns to classify patients.

### B.11.2 Precision Medicine Vision

**Long-term goal**:
1. Genotype patients for risk variants
2. Integrate with biomarkers (EEG, neuroimaging, metabolites)
3. Predict treatment response
4. Stratify clinical trials

**Current gap**:
- No validated genotype-phenotype mappings
- No genotype-treatment response data
- Biomarkers underdeveloped

**Timeline**: 10-20 years minimum before clinical implementation

---

## B.12 Ethical Considerations

### B.12.1 Genetic Testing

**Not recommended**:
- Gene enrichment patterns don't provide actionable information for individuals
- Psychosocial risks of genetic labeling
- No validated clinical utility

**If pursued in research**:
- Informed consent required
- Genetic counseling
- Privacy protections

### B.12.2 Stigma and Determinism

**Risks**:
- Genetic essentialism ("It's in their genes")
- Reduced expectations for individuals
- Discrimination (education, employment, insurance)

**Mitigations**:
- Emphasize polygenic, probabilistic nature
- Highlight gene-environment interactions
- Stress that genetics inform biology, not destiny

### B.12.3 Health Equity

**Concern**: European ancestry bias in GWAS

**Consequences**:
- Findings may not generalize to other populations
- Precision medicine benefits may be inequitably distributed
- Exacerbates health disparities

**Solutions**:
- Prioritize diverse cohorts
- Trans-ancestry meta-analyses
- Community engagement in research
